# Classify space rocks using python and AI

# Description

This learning path gives you a view into the worlds of AI and space. Learn how to create an AI model that can classify the type of space rock in a random photo.

This is a Microsoft course with the same name to learn about space rocks and how to classify them.

### Prerequisites

- A basic understanding of Python for Data Science

# Learn about space rocks and how to classify them

## Ways to use AI to improve space rock research

Integration AI into this process can imporve the collection process for both humans and rovers. For example, we could send astronauts to the Moon armed with a computer that can take photos of rocks. The computer could tell the astronaut what type of rock it likely is. The astronaut could then determie if that type of rocks is needed in the collection and decide to take it or not. This computer could also be placed in a rover that could autonomously drive across the surface of the Moon and scan for rocks that we need for research.

By integrating AI, astronauts could more quickly and accurately locate and identify rocks they should bring back to Earth. The computer also culd collect metadata like location, temperature, and light exposure. With accuracy feedback from astronauts and scientists on EArth, The AI model used to identify valuable rocks would be improved overtime.

## AI on Earth

As we mentioned earlier, AI performs better when the sample data is cleaner. We mean not only when the rocks are physically clean, but when the photos of the rocks have similar lighting (so the visual coloring of the rock is consistent), when edges between the rock and the background are clean and consistent, and when each photo has a clear indicaton of scale. An AI model that ould help identify, classify, and track these samples would provide clear instructions about how to take the photos to fit the current model. With an AI model that fits these criteria, lunar rock curation and lunar rock research would move toward answering even more nuanced research questions. Additionally, we could use a rover and AI on Earth to collect meteorites in Antarctica.

## The future of AI in space

Although AI and image quality might not be cood enugh today totake a satellite image of a planet's surface and five an overview of the types of rocks that are on it, we can start to understand where AI can help and whre it's limited.
